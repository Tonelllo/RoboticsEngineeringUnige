# How to install Metric-FF
For linux systems:
[Download from here](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff/FF-v2.3-newlines-parse-goldman.tgz)
For the full documentation refer to:
[Main page](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff.html)<br>
Inside the downloaded folder you will find the already built binary: `ff`. Put that in a folder inside your path and you are
good to go.<br>
If you are asking yourself: path? what path? Then follow these steps:
- Open a terminal
- Type `echo $PATH`
- The output should be something like: `/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`
- This is not the optimal way but now copy the `ff` executable inside `/usr/bin`. Please note that you will need root privileges to do that
- Done! You can use `ff` wherever you want

There is also a windows version that you can find here:
